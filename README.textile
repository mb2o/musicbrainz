h1. Last.fm API

This API will construct the appropriate Last.fm API URL to query, and use RequestCore and SimpleXML to retrieve and parse the data.

Because of the way that Last.fm handles authenticated requests, no extra work needs to be done at the API-level to support these requests. You will, however, need to manage your authentication tokens in your app as this API doesn't (and shouldn't) do that.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.2
* cURL
* SimpleXML
* "RequestCore":http://requestcore.googlecode.com
* "CacheCore":http://cachecore.googlecode.com (Optional)

h2. Example usage

To learn how to use this API, look through the unit tests that are included. These specific tests use "Test Mode," meaning that they return the URL rather than requesting the URL and returning the parsed response.

You would also put this API in Test Mode if you wanted to use your own HTTP and parsing classes.
