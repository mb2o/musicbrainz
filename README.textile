h1. MusicBrainz API

This API will construct the appropriate MusicBrainz API URL to query, and use RequestCore and SimpleXML to retrieve and parse the data.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.2
* cURL
* SimpleXML
* "RequestCore":http://requestcore.googlecode.com
* "CacheCore":http://cachecore.googlecode.com (Optional)

h2. Example usage

To learn how to use this API, look through the unit tests that are included. These specific tests use "Test Mode," meaning that they return the URL rather than requesting the URL and returning the parsed response.

You would also put this API in Test Mode if you wanted to use your own HTTP and parsing classes.
